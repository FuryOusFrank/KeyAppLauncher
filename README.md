# KeyAppLauncher
NEXTSPACE non-GNUstep app launcher using proper keyboard layout.

Somes keyboards layouts, while working in NEXTSPACE, are not working when launching a non-GNUstep application. This workaround while momentarily switch the system keyboard layout to "us" before reveting to the original keyboard layout. The original layout will then be prolerly recognised in the application.

**Usage**

Use KeyAppLauncher with the application as parameter:

`./KeyAppLauncher xterm`
